## Problem 1

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
mean_flipper_length <- mean(pull(penguins, flipper_length_mm), na.rm = TRUE)
```

The `penguins` dataset is a dataframe containing information about adult
foraging penguins near Palmer Station, Antarctica. Some important
variables are species, island, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm,
flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex, year. `species` is a factor
variable taking on 3 values, denoting the penguin species, Adélie,
Chinstrap and Gentoo, `island` tells us which island it came from
(Biscoe, Dream, or Torgersen), and various others are continuous,
quantitative variables characterizing the penguin’s body. There are 344
rows and 8 columns. The mean flipper length is 200.9152047.

Here is a scatterplot of the penguins’ bill length against their flipper
length, color-coded by their species.

``` r
peng_plot <- ggplot(penguins, aes(x=bill_length_mm, y=flipper_length_mm,
                     color = species))+geom_point()
peng_plot
```

## Problem 2

``` r
set.seed(123)
df <- tibble(rand_sample=rnorm(10, mean=0, sd=1), 
             vec_logical = rand_sample < 0,
             vec_char = c("Hi", "my", "name", "is", "Malika", 
                          "and", "I", "am", "studying", "biostatistics"),
            vec_factor = factor(c("rice", "noodle", "potato",
                                  "potato", "rice", "noodle",
                                  "potato", "rice", "rice", 
                                  "noodle")))
```

If we try to take the mean of each variable in this dataframe, we will
encounter errors for `vec_char` and `vec_factor` because they are not of
type numeric or logical. R only calculates the mean for these two types
of variables, which in this case is vec_logical (even though it is just
trues and falses, R automatically calculates True as 1 and False as 0)
with mean 0.5 and rand_sample with mean 0.0746256.

``` r
num_logical = as.numeric(pull(df,vec_logical))
mean(num_logical)
num_char = as.numeric(pull(df, vec_char))
mean(num_char)
num_factor = as.numeric(pull(df, vec_factor))
mean(num_factor)
```

If we converted the variables of type logical, character, and factor, to
be numeric using the `as.numeric` function, we would observe the same
answer for the first type but different answers for the second two.
Converting `vec_logical` to be numeric means that the new variable has
now switched from Trues and Falses to 1s and 0s, respectively, but the
mean is still the same (0.5) as explained in the previous part.
Converting `vec_character` to numeric doesn’t give us an error, but a
warning message because the values just become NA as there is no way for
R to make these text characters (that contain no numbers) into a number.
This would be different if some of the values in `vec_character`
included integers or real numbers. Converting `vec_factor` to numeric
does get us an actual mean though, of 2.1. This is because a factor
variable is encoded with numeric codes, and when converted, we obtain
the corresponding numeric code.
